About this Project:
    As an enthusiast of Machine Learning and Stock Market, this project lays a path to combine them both. Though in recent years many scholars, enthusiasts, and financial institutions have been trying to understand the market trend using machine learning, the accuracy rate of the machine-learning models hasn't met the desired goal.

Our Goal:
    The main goal to start this project is to consistently learn, develop, verify, modify, and improve new/existing trend-identification-techniques and machine-learning-models to better understand and predict the pattern that stock prices follow.

Version: 1.0 --> Short term goal
    Dataset:
        The pre-processed dataset includes Date, Open price, High, Low, Close price and Volume of Apple's stock starting from 2010 to 2017 
    Source:
        Dataset was provided at kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/fayomi/apple-stock-prices-from-20102017
    Machine-Learning Models:
        Version 1.0 implements Random Forest and Long-Short-Term Memory models to identify the trend of the stock.
